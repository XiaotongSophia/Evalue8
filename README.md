## Project Objectives

Our current project involves creating a user-friendly "PACT front-end page" in the client's app, enabling seamless interaction with PACT functionality. The main objectives include enhancing emission transparency, integrating PACT standards, offering subscription-based access, implementing robust back-end calculations, integrating PACT API, improving reporting and data formatting, and enhancing overall UI/UX.
